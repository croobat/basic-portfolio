      <p>Hello, I'm Luis Antonio Ram&iacute;rez Garc&iacute;a, a <strong>mechatronics engineer</strong> with a passion for
        programming, particularly web development. With my unique background in engineering and web development skills,
        I bring a diverse perspective to the projects I work on.</p>

      <p>My education in mechatronics engineering has given me a strong foundation in the fundamentals of engineering,
        including mathematics, physics, mechanics, and electronics. I also developed skills in <em>computer-aided
          design, simulation, and programming</em>. Throughout my academic career, I consistently sought out
        opportunities to develop my web development skills, which led me to work on several web-based projects.</p>

      <p>In my professional career, I have worked on a variety of web development projects, ranging from small personal
        websites to large-scale e-commerce platforms. I have expertise in several technologies, including HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, PHP, and Python, and I'm experienced in developing responsive and user-friendly web applications,
        particularly through the <strong>LAMP</strong> stack (<em>Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP</em>) and the
        <strong>MERN/MEVN</strong> stack (<em>MongoDB, Express, React/Vue and Node</em>). With my engineering background
        and web development skills, I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on.</p>

      <p>When I'm not working on my next project, you can find me tinkering with new gadgets or playing video games. I'm
        always up for a good challenge, and I enjoy pushing myself to learn and grow in my field.</p>

      <p>I'm a firm believer in discipline and constant self-improvement, and I strive to be ethical and responsible in
        everything I do. If you're looking for a passionate and dedicated engineer who loves what he does, you've come
        to the right place. Let's work together to create something amazing!</p>
